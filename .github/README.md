<h2 id="dotfile-explain">What Are Dotfiles?</h2>

Dotfiles are the customization files that are used to personalize your Linux or
other Unix-based system.  You can tell that a file is a dotfile because the name
of the file will begin with a period--a dot!  The period at the beginning of a
filename or directory name indicates that it is a hidden file or directory.

This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are stored here for convenience so
that I may quickly access them on new machines or new installs.  Also, others may find
some of my configurations helpful in customizing their own dotfiles.


<h2 id="manage-dotfiles">How To Manage Your Own Dotfiles?</h2>

There are a hundred ways to manage your dotfiles. Personally, I use the *git bare
repository method* for managing my dotfiles. Here is an article about this method
of managing your dotfiles: [Article Link](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/)
